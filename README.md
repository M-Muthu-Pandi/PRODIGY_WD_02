## How to Play

1. **Two-Player Mode**: Choose two-player mode to play against another player.
2. **Player vs AI**: Select player vs AI mode if you want to play against the computer.
3. The game is played on a 3x3 grid. Each player takes turns placing their symbol (X or O) on the grid. The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
4. If all spaces are filled without any player aligning three symbols, the game is considered a draw.
5. You can reset the game anytime by pressing the reset button.
